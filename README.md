Collection of assorted witnesses and functions for working with type-level
lists.

*   *Data.Type.List.Prod* contains a canonical vinyl-like parameterized
    heterogeneous list type, which is a common application of type-level lists
    and ties together applications in this library.
*   *Data.Type.List.Edit* contains single-item edits of lists, including
    insertion, deletion, and substitution.
*   *Data.Type.List.Sublist* contains witnesses for prefixes, suffixes, and
    two-way splits of type-level lists.
